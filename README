Simulation project that will grow incrementally.
The basic idea is that it's a world that will be populated by predators, herbivores, and plants.
In a first stage, this will be grass, rabbit, and wolf.

The world is run in ticks. Each tick is an update, where the animals move, eat, and breed, and the grass grows.

Animals:
- age: 0 when born and increased slowly for each tick. I guess each species has a max age, and the closer they get to it, the more likely they are to die of old age.
- sex: female or male. Under certain circumstances, 1 male and 1 female will breed when they meet.
- strength: High strength uses energy faster but can kill larger prey.
- agility: Determines how fast they move and how good they are at evading predators and catching prey.
- fatigue: More of a short-term indicator than energy. Energy is used to lower fatigue. Fatigue increases when hunting prey or evading predators.
- energy: Long-term indicator. Increases when the animal eats. If it reaches 0, the animal dies. Decreases slowly every tick, and more-so if the animal moves.



Actions:
 - eat
 - breed
 - rest

 Grass:
 - Grows 1 each tick
 - If no grass in a box, no growth
 - If grass above a certain number, spread to adjacent box
